          Growing up I was drawn to music, art, video games, technology, & writing - creative pursuits that naturally
          led me to web development. I&apos;ve always been fascinated by computers, from playing The Oregon Trail on
          floppy disks to Runescape on our family PC. The intersection of technology and artistic expression captivated
          me, even though I {`didn't`} yet understand how it all worked. To me, it was pure magic.

          In summer 2014, while taking a break from my business degree, I had a pivotal moment. The night I built my
          first gaming PC, I chose to begin the process of learning how to code instead of playing games. Inspired by a
          coworker&apos;s journey into software development, I spent that summer learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & Ruby
          on Rails. By fall, I had enrolled in DevMountain&apos;s full-stack boot camp, and by January 2015, I landed my
          first role as an Associate Engineer at IntegraCore <i>(now Maersk)</i>. There, I was fortunate to be mentored
          by exceptional Ruby on Rails developers who shaped my foundations. That beginning has grown into a decade-long
          full-stack career where I&apos;m still amazed by how much there is to learn and create.

          Today I&apos;m a seasoned full-stack software engineer with a passion for frontend development. Through both
          successes and challenges, I&apos;ve learned that while modern software is never truly &quot;done&quot;,
          it&apos;s the people behind it and processes that drive success. I&apos;ve scaled Node.js APIs from launch to
          enterprise-level and helped craft Design Systems. As we enter the age of AI, I&apos;m excited by how these new
          tools can enhance our productivity. The landscape keeps evolving, and I&apos;m thrilled to continue growing
          alongside it.
